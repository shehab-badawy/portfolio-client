              I'm a computer engineering graduate and current MEng student at the University of Ottawa,
              passionate about software development, embedded systems, and machine learning. I've worked on a
              wide range of projects, including backend systems using Spring Boot and NestJS, gesture-controlled
              interfaces with MediaPipe, and embedded applications involving microcontrollers and sensor integration.
              I'm always eager to explore new technologies and tackle challenging problems. Outside of tech, I enjoy
              playing padel tennis, diving into story-rich video games like Baldurâ€™s Gate 3 and Sekiro, and
              discovering new cultures through travel.
